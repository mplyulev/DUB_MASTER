ACIDISED/WAV FILES


WAV files are the most commonly used audio format, compatible with 99% of software/Hardware, 
PC & Mac.  
The term ‘Acidised’ means the loops have been specially prepared for use with 
Sony ‘Acid’ Software. In Acid you can import a loop at virtually any tempo and sync 
it with other Acidised loops. Its worth noting that if you are not using Sony Acid, 
You cam use these .wav files just the same.
